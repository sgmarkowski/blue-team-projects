# Blue Team Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Blue Team Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity labs, investigations, and hands-on exercises focused on blue team operations, incident response, and threat analysis.

## Repository Structure

- **letsdefend/** — A folder containing detailed SOC analyst labs completed through the LetsDefend platform, including investigation notes, file analysis, sandboxing, and remediation steps.
- *(More folders coming soon as I continue to expand my portfolio.)*

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized portfolio showcasing my practical skills in threat detection, malware analysis, phishing investigations, and endpoint security through real-world simulated exercises.

Feel free to explore the folders for detailed walkthroughs and documented evidence of my cybersecurity journey.

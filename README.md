\# LetsDefend Labs



This folder contains my hands-on blue team labs and exercises completed through the LetsDefend SOC Analyst training platform.



Each subfolder includes a specific lab scenario, along with supporting documentation, screenshots, and analysis steps I followed to investigate and respond to alerts.
